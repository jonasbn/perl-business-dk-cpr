Release 0.05, update recommended for perl 5.10 users

- Eliminated use of the marvellous Hash::Merge, problems with Clone under
  perl 5.10 makes the code break. Hash::Merge uses Clone so I am removing it's
  use since it is breaking my code:
  
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40957

  I mimicking Hash::Merge's merge in my own simple merge function, which does
  however demonstrate that use of Hash::Merge might be overkill for this task

- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP wrong distribution listed

- Cleaned regular expressions


Release 0.04, update recommended

- Introduced Data::FormValidator::Constraints::Business::DK::CPR, this is sort
  of an example application, it is however just a simple wrapper fitting into
  the Data::FormValidator::Constraints framework - it is should be usable, not
  just a demo, but still experimental

- Changed from brute force validation in validation2007, we now do a combination
  of calculations and assertions (refactoring might be necessary, all tests do
  pass)

- The generate method now a wrapper around the two specific generators

- Added new methods:
    - generate1968
    - generate2007

  for generating CPR numbers compatible with their validate equivalents

- Changed the word sex to gender in the code, sounds nicer

- Added new script to bin/validate_cpr.pl

- Added use of _assert_date to validate methods (missing this was a serious flaw
  if not to say bug)

- Added use of constants in more places

- Changed the return values for the validate methods:
    1, indicates male gender
    2, indicates female gender

- Added a use integer, since we only use integers

- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP to more contemporary version

- Introduced validateCPR a wrapper on validate (validate is a quite
  polluting name for export).

- Cleaned the code a bit to follow Perl::Critic policies, nothing
  serious See also the POD section in Business::DK::CPR on TEST AND
  QUALITY

- Updated POD to adhere to Perl::Critic template (see: t/perlcriticrc)

- Introduced README file generator in Build.PL

- Introduced recursive test flag in Build.PL and restructured test
  suite to reflect this:
  
    t/validate.t -> t/Business/DK/CPR/validate.t
    t/calculate.t -> t/Business/DK/CPR/calculate.t
    t/_checkdate.t -> t/Business/DK/CPR/_checkdate.t
    
    New tests:
    
    t/Business/DK/CPR/validate1968.t
    t/Business/DK/CPR/validate2007.t
    
- Refactored validate to be a wrapper around: validate1968 and validate2007, so
  the original modulus validation has propagated into validate1968, since 1968
  was the year CPR was introduced in Denmark

- Introduced validate2007 as an implementation the new validation introduced in
  2007

- Added LICENSE file 

- Added LICENSE section in POD into. The LICENSE section was not present, but 
  the information was


Release 0.03 - Released Wed Mar 13 2007 Update not necessary

- Added Perl::Critic test t/critic.t and related t/perlcriticrc, we currently
  pass at severity 5, gentle

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


Release 0.02 - Released Wed Mar 1 2006 Update not necessary

- Fixed a small POD error, reported by htoug (thanks)


Release 0.01 - Released Tue Feb 21 2006

- Initial version
