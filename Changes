HEAD, Release 0.04 candidate, update recommended

- Changed the word sex to gender in the code, sounds nicer

- Added new script to bin/ validate_cpr.pl

- Added use of _assert_date to validate methods (missing this was a serious flaw
  if not to say bug)

- Added use of constants in more places

- Changed the return values for the validate methods:
    1, indicates male gender
    2, indicates female gender

- Added a use integer, since we only use integers

- Updated MANIFEST.SKIP to more contemporary version

- Introduced validateCPR a wrapper on validate (validate is a quite polluting
  name for export).

- Cleaned the code a bit to follow Perl::Critic policies, nothing serious
  See also the POD section in Business::DK::CPR on TEST AND QUALITY

- Updated POD to adhere to Perl::Critic template (see: t/perlcriticrc)

- Introduced README file generator in Build.PL

- Introduced recursive test flag in Build.PL and restructured test suite to
  reflect this:
  
    t/validate.t -> t/Business/DK/CPR/validate.t
    t/calculate.t -> t/Business/DK/CPR/calculate.t
    t/_checkdate.t -> t/Business/DK/CPR/_checkdate.t
    
    New tests:
    
    t/Business/DK/CPR/validate1968.t
    t/Business/DK/CPR/validate2007.t
    
- Refactored validate to be a wrapper around: validate1968 and validate2007, so
  the original modulus validation has propagated into validate1968, since 1968
  was the year CPR was introduced in Denmark

- Introduced validate2007 as an implementation the new validation introduced in
  2007

- Added LICENSE file 

- Added LICENSE section in POD into. The LICENSE section was not present, but 
  the information was


Release 0.03 - Released Wed Mar 13 2007 Update not necessary

- Added Perl::Critic test t/critic.t and related t/perlcriticrc, we currently
  pass at severity 5, gentle

- Updated to more contemporary versions of:
    t/pod-coverage.t
    t/pod.t

  These should be there for the quality, but will not be run as a part of the
  normal test run, unless the TEST_POD environment variable is set.
  
  This seem to be the defacto way of doing things.


Release 0.02 - Released Wed Mar 1 2006 Update not necessary
